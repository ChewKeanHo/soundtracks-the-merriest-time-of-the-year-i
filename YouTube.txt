TITLE
🎧 | The Merriest Time of the Year I




DESCRIPTION
Well, Christmas 2025 is coming. Given the current economy where everyone is on an extremely tight budget, I created these soundtracks just in case someone is having a quiet festival. The intention is clear: I just wish everyone can still have a great festival. Here's the first version.

(1) Can I use this music for my video, my business broadcast, etc?

**YES BUT YOU MUST CREDIT THE CREATORS AS PER THE LICENSE REQUIREMENT** (read: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ). This is the ONLY requirement. By all means, you can do it by adding the following into your video description or mentions the origin is sufficient:

There is no limit on number of use (as in royalty or project based charges).

(2) Can you license the music for my project?

**DOES NOT HAVE TO** since the current license is very liberal and open to use.

(3) Is this another A.I. Slop?

**NOT REALLY**

I do listen to all my musics, edit, purge, and optimize them until it passed my quality baseline.

(4) Why A.I. & Not Directly Invest Into Music Instruments?

**A.I. IS CHEAPER, LESS RISKY, AND NEW TO EXPLORE**

I'm a tech guy specialized in semi-automatic technologies. Personally, I love music but asking me to fully throw more than USD100k just to create a few musics in this economy is too much to ask. Moreover, the minimum amount of time and effort required to reach professional level is very unforgiving.

Secondly, I'm a tech guy. Applied A.I. is part of my domain. I don't see a problem using it as a general purpose musical instrument. Besides, I did not restrict any professional musicians not to use A.I. unfairly. It's just personal opinions.

I just see A.I. is the next step forward and I want it to augment me; not resisting it and self-making myself obsolete.
