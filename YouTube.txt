(2) Can you license the music for my project?

**DOES NOT HAVE TO** since the current license is very liberal and open to use.

(3) Is this another A.I. Slop?
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
**NO**

Unlike A.I. Slop that fully automate all kinds of A.I. output disregarding audiences' appreciations and flooding the publishers with nonsense contents, I do listen to all my musics, edit, purge, and optimize them until it passed my quality baseline.

Currently, the ratio of successful tracks you're hearing here is like 32/200 successful retries. Sometimes I got 1/120 retries or wrost: 0/120. Also, I process the lyrics (whenever applicable) on my own.

I only use A.I. with Cyborg approach; not full automation. Human is still in full control.

(4) Why A.I. & Not Directly Invest Into Music Instruments?

**A.I. IS CHEAPER, LESS RISKY, AND NEW TO EXPLORE**

I'm a tech guy specialized in semi-automatic technologies. Personally, I love music but asking me to fully throw more than USD100k just to create a few musics in this economy is too much to ask. Moreover, the minimum amount of time and effort required to reach professional level is very unforgiving.

Secondly, I'm a tech guy. Applied A.I. is part of my domain. I don't see a problem using it as a general purpose musical instrument. Besides, I did not restrict any professional musicians not to use A.I. unfairly. It's just personal opinions.

I just see A.I. is the next step forward and I want it to augment me; not resisting it and self-making myself obsolete.
